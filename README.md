### Story

Silvia has a dream that should be interpreted. She is in a strange place and she has to find the way out.


## How to play

This is a point and click game, so you can play it with mouse only and space bar to skip step. 
Sometimes you have to use the keyboard to move the character.
Press space to next step if somehow the screen doesn't change.

Ah! for exit the game just close the window/tab.
